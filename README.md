# cli-weather-app

This is a weather app that can be executed from the command line interface(CLI). Additionally, it may (optionally) fetch the 5-day forecast for the chosen city (in 3-hour periods). The app makes use of various free-to-use REST APIs provided by OpenWeather. The Geocoding API helps the user streamline their search by returning a list of all cities with duplicate names. The weather output has been styled using python libraries and emojis for increased visual appeal and readability.
