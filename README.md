# cli-weather-app

This is a weather app that can be executed from the command line interface(CLI). Additionally, it may (optionally) fetch the 5-day forecast for the chosen city (in 3-hour periods). The app makes use of various free-to-use REST APIs provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api). </br></br>
The [Geocoder API](https://openweathermap.org/current#geocoding) helps the user streamline their search by returning a list of all cities with duplicate names. The [Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#multi) uses the latitude and longitude of the selected city to build the endpoint request.</br></br>
The weather output has been styled using python libraries and emojis for increased visual appeal and readability. Furthermore, users can have the app return weather descriptions in their target language. </br>
